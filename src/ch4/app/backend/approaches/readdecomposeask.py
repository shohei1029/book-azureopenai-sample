Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector
of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the
area.
Action: Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation: <info1.pdf> The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in
Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern
sector.
Action: Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation: <info2.txt> (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called
the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I
need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action: Search[High Plains]
Observation: <some_file.pdf> High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action: Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation: <filea.pdf> The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. <another-ref.docx> From east to west, the
High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130
m).
Thought: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer
is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft <filea.pdf>]""",
    """Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons"
character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought: The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after
who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action: Search[Milhouse]
Observation: <info7.pdf> Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated
television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt
Groening.
Thought: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up
"named after".
Action: Lookup[named after]
Observation: <historyref2.txt> (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose
middle name was Milhous.
Thought: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is
Richard Nixon.

    """Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The
Saimaa Gesture?
Thought: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which
documentary is about Finnish rock groups.

Observation: <info9.pdf> Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell
III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office
Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', vAdam Clayton Powell
(film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].
Thought: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).
Action: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]
Observation: <data123.txt> Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by
Richard Kilberg. The film is about the rise and fall of influential
African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired
as part of the PBS series The American Experience.
Thought: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American
politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock
groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.
Action: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture <data123.txt>]""",
    """Question: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?
Thought: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then
find the profession they have in common.

to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.
Action: Search[Elia Kazan]
Observation: <files-654.txt> Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter
and actor.
Thought: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.
So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director,
screenwriter, and actor.

Action: Search[First for Women]
Observation: <magazines-1900.pdf> First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the
USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989.
Thought: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First
for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.
